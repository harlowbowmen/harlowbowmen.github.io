## Introduction
We are small friendly groups of archers welcoming beginers and veterans alike.  Due to the small size of the club we are adults only as we do not have capacity for a junior section. 

## Meetings
The club meets on Wednesday evenings at Thornwood Village Hall during the winter (except the last Wednesday of the month), and weather permitting at the outdoor range in Roydon during the summer.  We welcome visiting archers, there is a guest fee per session and you'll need to show your GNAS membership card.

## Membership
There is an annual membership fee set by the club committee each year, with the year starting 1st September.  If you join during the year your fee will be pro-rated for the remainder of the year, although your membership fees for Archery GB (required for insurance coverage) will be subject to their terms.  There are no shooting/attendance fees.
