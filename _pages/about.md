## Introduction
We are small friendly groups of archers welcoming beginers and veterans alike.  Due to the small size of the club we are adults only as we do not have capacity for a junior section. 

## Meetings
The club meets on Wednesday evenings (except the last Wednesday of the month) 7pm to 10pm at Thornwood Village Hall from autumn to spring, and weather permitting during the summer at Roydon Primary School from 6pm to dusk.  We welcome visiting archers, there is a guest fee of Â£5 per session and you'll need to show your GNAS membership card.

There are tea, coffee and biscuits provided when we are shooting indoors. We also have a Halloween, Christmas & Easter shoot indoors to add bit of fun to the cold dark winter months.

## Membership
There is an annual membership fee set by the club committee each year, with the year starting 1st September.  If you join during the year your fee will be pro-rated for the remainder of the year, although your membership fees for Archery GB (required for insurance coverage) will be subject to their terms.  There are no shooting/attendance fees.

Membership is subject to available capacity.  The indoor venue is small which limits our ability to accept new members.  If you wish to join the please see the [Join Us]({% link _pages/joinus.md %}) page.

## Bows
Members currently shoot the following bows:

### Recurve
This is the most common type of bow used at the club, and is the type you'll have seen at the Olympics.

### Compound
These are highly technical mechanical bows, often incorporating telescopic sights and trigger release aids.  You'll typically see them used in target competitions.

### Longbow
When you think of Robin Hood shooting his bow and arrow, this is what you're thinking of.  These are fully wooden bows and have no sights, so depend purely upon the judgement of the bowman.
