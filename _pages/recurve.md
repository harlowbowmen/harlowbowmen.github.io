# Recurve Bow

A recurve bow is a type of bow that has limbs which curve away from the archer at the tips when unstrung. This design stores more energy and delivers it more efficiently compared to a straight-limbed bow of the same length.

Key features of a recurve bow:

- Curved limb tips: The "recurve" shape allows the bow to generate more power without needing to be excessively long.

- Compact size: Because of its design, a recurve bow can be shorter than a longbow but still produce similar or greater arrow speed, making it easier to handle in tight spaces.

- Smooth draw: The curve distributes stress along the limbs, leading to a smoother draw cycle.

- Widely used in modern archery: The recurve bow is the only type of bow allowed in Olympic archery competitions.

Recurve bows can be one-piece (a solid frame) or takedown (with removable limbs for easier transport and customization).
