## Welcome
We welcome all genders, backgrounds and skill levels. Don't worry if you've never used a bow before, we will teach you. If you have already completed training with an accredited instructor then you are welcome to join straight away.  If you haven't been fully trained then you will need to complete our training course before you can become a member.  Unfortunately due to our size we do not have a junior section and therefore we are an adults only club.

## Training
Our training courses run when the certified coaches are available. Each course consists of four evening sessions 19:30 until 21:30 on Wednesdays at our indoor venue, Thornwood Village Hall. You must attend all four sessions to become certified and eligible to become a full member.

During the training we will provide you with all the equipment you need. We will teach you the basics and supervise you to ensure your safety and to guide you towards firing with accuracy.  Each course costs Â£60 per person (as of 2025), you will be notified of the current pricing as part of the booking process. Payment is accepted via cash or cheque.

We strongly recommend you do not buy any equipment without first discussing it with our coaches.  When you're starting out it is easy to waste a lot of money on unsuitable equipment.

## Full Membership
There is an annual membership fee set by the club committee each year, with the year starting 1st September. If you join during the year your fee will be pro-rated for the remainder of the year, although your membership fees for Archery GB (required for insurance coverage) will be subject to their terms. There are no shooting/attendance fees.

Membership is subject to available capacity. The indoor venue is small which limits our ability to accept new members.
